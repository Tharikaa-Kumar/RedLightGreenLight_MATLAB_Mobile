# Red Light, Green Light Balance Test 🚦

**Test your balance using your phone and MATLAB Mobile!**

Can you stay perfectly still when the “Red Light” comes on? This interactive physics challenge uses your phone’s accelerometer to measure your movement as you play a game of Red Light, Green Light—just like in childhood, but with science! 📱🧑‍🔬

## How It Works

- **Green Light:** Move around for 5 seconds—get your wiggles out!
- **Red Light:** Freeze! Hold your phone steady against your chest and try not to move for 5 seconds.
- The script measures your net acceleration (with gravity removed) to see how steady you really are.
- Get instant feedback and see your results on a simple, mobile-friendly plot.

## What You Need

- MATLAB Mobile app (iOS or Android)
- This script, running in MATLAB on your computer

## Why Try It?

- Fun, quick way to learn about acceleration and motion
- Challenge yourself or your friends—who has the best balance?
- Great for classrooms, science fairs, or just testing your own steadiness

## How To Use

1. Open MATLAB Mobile and enable the Acceleration sensor.
2. Run this script in MATLAB on your computer.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions—move, freeze, and see your results!
