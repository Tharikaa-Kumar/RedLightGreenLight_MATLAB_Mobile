# Red Light, Green Light Balance Test üö¶

**Test your balance using your phone and MATLAB Mobile!**

Can you stay perfectly still when the ‚ÄúRed Light‚Äù comes on? This interactive physics challenge uses your phone‚Äôs accelerometer to measure your movement as you play a game of Red Light, Green Light‚Äîjust like in childhood, but with science! üì±üßë‚Äçüî¨

## How It Works

- **Green Light:** Move around for 5 seconds‚Äîget your wiggles out!
- **Red Light:** Freeze! Hold your phone steady against your chest and try not to move for 5 seconds.
- The script measures your net acceleration (with gravity removed) to see how steady you really are.
- Get instant feedback and see your results on a simple, mobile-friendly plot.

## What You Need

- MATLAB Mobile app (iOS or Android)
- This script, saved in your MATLAB Drive, then run on your mobile. Just click on 'Open in MATLAB Online' above to save it your MATLAB Drive.
  You can do this from your mobile web browser as well!

## Why Try It?

- Fun, quick way to learn about acceleration and motion
- Challenge yourself or your friends‚Äîwho has the best balance?
- Great for classrooms, science fairs, or just testing your own steadiness

## How To Use

1. Open MATLAB Mobile and enable the Acceleration sensor.
2. Run this script in MATLAB on your computer.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions‚Äîmove, freeze, and see your results!
